# SGDK Rocks

[SGDK](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK) Example Code.   Updated for SGDK 2.11.

This project contain some example programs and a "playable" version of Asteroids.
The example programs here are based on notes I've taken while learning to use SGDK. 
I'm in no way saying this code is the best way to do things. It's just a bunch of
tests based on various SGDK tutorials and old game code I've found on the web.



```bash
   sed -i -e 's/fix32ToInt/F32_toInt/g' main.c 
   sed -i -e 's/fix32Div/F32_div/g' main.c 
```
